## General strategies and mnemonics

Thought process is generally a more important signal than only whether you get the "right" answer in the time limit.

_**Don't get stuck:**_ In your own words. Aloud. Draw. Examples. Manually. Pseudocode. Brute force first. `Ot(?)` and `Os(?)`. Best conceivable runtime. Patterns. Heuristics. Base case and build. Try with just one item first (even for an iterative solution). See if sorting helps you find a pattern. Run through the data structure "alphabet" (hash table, etc.).

Aside tip for DP (besides likely won't be asked): recursion -> repeated work -> subproblems -> choices. Some heuristics for identifying DP problems: https://interviewing.io/dynamic-programming-interview-questions#heuristics-for-identify-dp-problems and https://interviewing.io/dynamic-programming-interview-questions#common-mistakes

## Practice

[NeetCode video explanations and tips](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLot-Xpze53leF0FeHz2X0aG3zd0mr1AW_)

[CtCI (Cracking the Coding Interview)](https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com) and [approaches](https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/uploads/6/5/2/8/6528028/cracking_the_coding_skills_-_v6.pdf) and [behavioral](https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/uploads/6/5/2/8/6528028/cracking_the_soft_skills_-_v6.pdf).

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com): practice/explanations of [fundamentals](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn) and [simulated assessments/interviews](https://leetcode.com/assessment). Otherwise filter by rating for quality questions, or find the topic lists curated by LeetCode staff, which also have official explanations and solutions. Or just use this curated list of 100 questions to cover core concepts/techniques per category: https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/419062/List-of-LeetCode-question-to-cover-all-the-concepts-and-type-of-questions/415034

[CPH (Competitive Programmer's Handbook)](https://github.com/pllk/cphb).

[AlgoExpert](https://www.algoexpert.io): less questions, but more focus. No need to filter questions for quality questions/solutions/explanations like you would for LeetCode. Curated content, explanation videos, and tips for behavioural, etc. AlgoExpert = deeper into conceptual consolidation; LeetCode = wider practice.
